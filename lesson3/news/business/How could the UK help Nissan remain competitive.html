        </figure><p>That could easily fall foul of World Trade Organisation rules because export subsidies are banned - they are defined as subsidies contingent on export performance. So direct compensation for a tariff looks like it would be caught.  </p><p>Some creative design of the compensation might get around it, breaking the explicit link with tariffs and export sales. </p><p>Even so Nissan&apos;s competitors in other countries would in all likelihood be alert to any such move and could still persuade a government to take the case to the WTO&apos;s dispute settlement system, arguing that the arrangement was in effect a prohibited subsidy. </p><p>The UK could then ignore the WTO ruling. </p><p>But in that event the Organisation can then authorise retaliation - additional tariffs - against a range of British exports. </p><p>In any case, British governments have generally been keen on the WTO and its system of international trade based on rules that constrain subsidies and trade barriers. </p><p>So Britain would probably be reluctant to defy a WTO ruling. </p><p>There is another possibility suggested by the former Prime Minister Tony Blair on BBC Radio 4.</p><p>&quot;I should imagine they gave strong assurances about the car industry&apos;s access to the single market&quot;. </p><p>If that is the case it would mean no tariffs and no need for any compensation.</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width">
